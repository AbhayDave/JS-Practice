1. Variables and Scope
Challenge: Create a function that demonstrates the difference between block scope and function scope. Inside this function, use let and const to declare variables within different scopes (global, function, and block). Show how reassigning variables works with let in a loop, and attempt to reassign a const to trigger an error. Illustrate how variables declared with var in a loop become accessible outside of the loop, highlighting the difference in scope handling.

2. ES6+ Features
Arrow Functions Challenge: Convert a traditional function that uses the this keyword to access an object's property into an arrow function. Show how this behaves differently in both cases.
Template Literals Challenge: Write a function that uses template literals to return a multi-line string that includes variables.
Destructuring Assignment Challenge: Create an object with nested objects and an array. Write a function that uses destructuring to extract values from the object and the array.
Default Parameters Challenge: Define a function with default parameters and demonstrate how it behaves when called with and without arguments.
Spread/Rest Operator Challenge: Write two functions, one that uses the rest operator to collect arguments into an array and another that uses the spread operator to spread an array into separate arguments for a function call.
Modules Challenge: Create two modules, one that exports a function or variable, and another that imports and uses that function or variable.
Callback Function Challenge: Implement a simple example of a callback function, such as a function that takes another function as an argument and executes it after performing an operation.
3. Functions and this
Challenge: Write an example of a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument. Inside this function, use both a traditional function and an arrow function and explain how this behaves differently in each.

4. Asynchronous JavaScript
Promises Challenge: Create a function that returns a promise that resolves after a delay. Use .then() and .catch() to handle the resolved or rejected state.
Async/Await Challenge: Rewrite the promises challenge using async/await syntax.
Fetch API/Axios Challenge: Make a simple GET request to a public API using both Fetch API and Axios, and display the results.
5. Array and Object Manipulations
Array Methods Challenge: Create an array of objects where each object contains information about a person (name, age, job). Use map(), filter(), and reduce() to transform this array.
Object Literals Challenge: Create an object that represents a book, including properties for title, author, and a method that returns a summary of the book.
String Methods Challenge: Write a function that takes a string and demonstrates the use of includes(), slice(), and any other string method of your choice.

6. Prototypes and Inheritance
Challenge: Create an object using Object.create() with a prototype that includes a method. Demonstrate how you can create new objects that inherit from this prototype and how you can override the inherited method.

7. Class Syntax
Challenge: Define a class that represents a simple UI component, such as a Button or Modal. Include properties like label and methods like click(). Demonstrate inheritance by creating a subclass that extends this component with additional functionality or properties.

8. DOM Manipulation and Event Handling
Challenge: Create a simple HTML page with a button. Write JavaScript code to change the text of the button when it is clicked. Also, include an example of event delegation by attaching an event listener to a parent element and handling clicks on its child elements.

9. Error Handling
Challenge: Write a function that tries to parse JSON from a string. Use a try-catch block to handle the case where the string is not valid JSON. Additionally, simulate an asynchronous operation that can fail and use a try-catch block to handle errors.
